description: '"This work contains the chief ideas gathered together for a course of
  lectures on the theory and history of aesthetics given at Harvard College from 1892
  to 1895. The only originality the author claims is that which may result from the
  attempt to put together the scattered commonplaces of criticism into a system, under
  the inspiration of a naturalistic psychology. His effort throughout has been to
  recall those fundamental aesthetic feelings the orderly extension of which yields
  sanity of judgment and distinction of taste"--Pref. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
